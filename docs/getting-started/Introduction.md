The idea is to offer a solution that simplifies adding filters to queries in Laravel, making your code cleaner,
maintainable and easier to use. With our product, you will be able to implement advanced filters without needing to
repeat logic in multiple places in your application. This approach centralizes the filtering logic, allowing filters to
be easily configurable and reusable. Additionally, by providing a clear structure for defining and applying filters, we
achieve greater consistency in how queries are handled throughout your application, which in turn makes your code easier
to read and maintain.

Our product is designed to be intuitive and flexible, offering support for a variety of specific filters and logical
combinations. Using a base filter class and a filter manager, you can add custom filters and apply them to your queries
efficiently. This solution not only reduces complexity and code duplication, but also improves your application's
ability to expand and adapt to new filtering needs. In short, this tool will become a fundamental piece for those
looking to maintain clean and manageable code in their Laravel projects, providing a simple and powerful way to manage
complex queries.
